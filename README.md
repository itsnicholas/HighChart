Apple Inc. stock chart web app

Language: JavaScript

Keywords: React, TypeScript, Node.js/Express, Highcharts, Docker, Heroku

The web app displays an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) 100 day stock chart. The frontend performs a GET request to the backend, and displays the Apple Inc. stock chart based on the response on render. When the backend is called by the frontendâ€™s GET request, the backend makes GET request to the Alpha Vantage API and this response data is sent with the response to the frontend.

To run the program, go to the root of the project and build it with ``` docker-compose up ```.
After this the program can be accessed at http://localhost:3000
The backend API data can be accesses at http://localhost:3001/api/data 

The project can be accessed at: https://afternoon-peak-54447.herokuapp.com/

The project would benefit from e.g. using better documentation standards and perhaps using a library for validation of external data received by the backend.
