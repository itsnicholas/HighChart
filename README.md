Apple Inc. stock chart web app

Language: JavaScript

Keywords: React, TypeScript, Node.js/Express, Highcharts, Heroku

The web app displays an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) 100 day stock chart. The frontend performs a GET request to the backend, and displays the Apple Inc. stock chart based on the response on render. When the backend is called by the frontendâ€™s GET request, the backend makes GET request to the Alpha Vantage API and this response data is sent with the response to the frontend.

The project can be accessed at: https://afternoon-peak-54447.herokuapp.com/

The project would benefit from e.g. using better documentation standards and perhaps using a library for validation of external data received by the backend.
